# Vercel Deployment Guide for Digital Guardian

## Project Structure Analysis

After analyzing your project structure, I've identified the following key points:

1. Your project is a React application built with Vite
2. The `index.html` file is correctly located inside the `client` directory as per Vite's standard structure
3. The build configuration in `vite.config.ts` sets the output directory to `dist/public`
4. The 404 errors on Vercel are likely due to missing SPA routing configuration

## Why You're Getting 404 Errors

The 404 errors occur because Vercel doesn't know how to handle client-side routing by default. When you navigate to routes like `/about` or `/contact`, Vercel looks for physical files at those paths, which don't exist since they're handled by your React router.

## Solution Implemented

I've created a `vercel.json` configuration file in your project root with the following settings:

```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }
  ],
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist/public",
  "framework": "vite"
}
```

This configuration:

1. Redirects all requests to your `index.html` file, allowing your client-side router to handle the routing
2. Specifies the correct build command and output directory
3. Tells Vercel that you're using Vite as your framework

## Deployment Steps

1. Push your code to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)
2. Log in to your Vercel account
3. Click "Add New" â†’ "Project"
4. Import your repository
5. Vercel should automatically detect your Vite configuration
6. Click "Deploy"

## Additional Notes

- The `index.html` file should remain in the `client` directory as it's correctly configured in your Vite setup
- Make sure your `package.json` scripts are properly set up for building the application
- If you're using environment variables, you'll need to configure them in the Vercel dashboard

After deploying with this configuration, your client-side routing should work correctly, and you should no longer see 404 errors when navigating to different routes in your application.
